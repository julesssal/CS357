This webapp is a sample photography club membership site. The site allows users to upload photography equipment to be borrowed by other members. The equipment is uploaded with a name and optional image. The user can login/signup with an email and password. The user is then shown the list of all equipment uploaded, who owns the equipment, and the status of the equipment(available/borrowed). The user can go to a page where they will have the ability to upload their own equipment. Only the owner of the equipment borrowed can change the status of equipment from borrowed to available. The application consists of a HTML and CSS styled user interface. The interface is currently adapted and styled to fit a 1280x600px screen. The application server is be written in PHP with JavaScript authentication. The backend database is mySQL. The local hosting tool used was MAMP.
